# Craps Game Simulator in C++

This project implements a multiplayer version of the "craps" game in C++, accommodating between two and five players. It includes features like betting and dynamic player order determined by dice rolls. The program handles gameplay seamlessly, ensuring continuous operation and robust error handling. Key functionalities include:

Accepting the number of players and their bets at the start of each game.

Determining the order of play based on dice rolls and resolving ties automatically.

Implementing standard craps rules, extended with betting mechanics and multi-player logic.

Handling invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect number of players or invalid data) with user feedback.

Reporting the gains or losses of each player at the end of the game.

Supporting an infinite game loop where new games can begin immediately after the previous one ends.
